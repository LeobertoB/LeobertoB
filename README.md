- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeobertoB, and I am an Artificial Intelligence Developer at Hotelnet S.r.l, currently focusing on automating the company’s processes — from organizing internal sectors to generating business reports through AI agents that deliver valuable insights to our clients.  
I work remotely from Mantova, Italy, while enjoying the close company of my wife and daughter.

- 👀 I’m eager to learn as much as I can and master Machine Learning and the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions. I recently enrolled in an Honours Degree in Software Engineering & Artificial Intelligence at EPICODE. I have also completed a Post-Graduate Degree in Artificial Intelligence from UTFPR — Technological Federal University of Paraná, Brazil.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my skills, especially in using AI workflows and creating Large Language Models to deliver top-quality code.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any event or project that will help me keep learning and growing every day.

- 📫 You can reach me through my e-mail address (leobittencourtfilho@gmail.com) or my LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoberto-bittencourt-filho-960182163/).
