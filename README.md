- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeobertoB, and I just started to learn how to code. It's my first steps, so I chose to create a freeCodeCamp account to have a general view of this new area. After some time, I joined Mate Academy
Bootcamp to get my certification and evolve my learning process, together with some books that have been recommended to me. 
I currently work remotely as an Internal Auditor for a private company in Brazil, but I live in Mantova, Italy with my wife and my daughter.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can to feel secure enough to land a job in tech here in Europe, so I can finally be able to enter this magnificent and promising area that, in the future, can be a
"must" to all professionals that really want to evolve.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Full-Stack Development path in the bootcamp, and I'm also enrolled in an Artificial Intelligence Post Graduate Course in UTFPR (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any event or project that I can possibly take to learn everyday more and more.

- 📫 You can reach me through my e-mail address (leobittencourtfilho@gmail.com) or my LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoberto-bittencourt-filho-960182163/).
